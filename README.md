# Turing Planner
This is a side project I am experimenting with in order to grow my skills. The idea came to me to create an all in one dashboard for students of my bootcamp, Turing School of Software and Design, in order to keep track of our daily activities and lessons.

Skills and exposure:
- Google Slides and Calendar API using the Google Cloud Platform
- Sidekiq gem in order to get background workers going to make calls in the background
- Redis database in order to store API images
- Hotwire and Turbo front end
- Tailwind CSS
